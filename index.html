				<h2>Overview</h2>
				<p>I believe that the <span class="snippet">2010 Volvo XC60 sold to me by Gengras Volvo of Meriden in December 2013</span> <span class="snippet">came with a pre-existing leaky sunroof due to clogged drains</span>. The leak is believed to have caused the climate control module malfunction that was repaired in January 2014 (under the Connecticut Used Car Warranty), and is evidence that <span class="snippet">the leak likely existed before the sale of the vehicle</span>. Given the possibility of the previous presence of water throughout the car, <span class="snippet">the worry exists that there may be other undiagnosed problems with the vehicle such as rust issues, mold, electronic or mechanical failures, and other issues directly relatable to the water</span>. Had the cause of the malfunction been diagnosed before the warranty expired, a used car nightmare as depicted below could have been avoided.</p>

				<h2>Additional Details</h2>

				<h3>A Rainy Day</h3>
				<p>On June 5th, 2014, upon entering the car to drive to work, I noticed the <a href="/images/damage/IMG_2101.JPG" class="image reference">driver's side floormat was sitting in a puddle of water</a>. Then, turning towards the drivers seat, I noticed <a href="/images/damage/IMG_2099.JPG" class="image reference">water all over the horizontal panel</a> between the seats, falling next to the shifter. When I looked "up", that is when I saw the <a href="/images/damage/IMG_2098.JPG" class="image reference">water coming in from the overhead light housing</a>.</p>

				<h3>Identifying the leak variables</h3>
				<p>The Volvo XC60 was bought used with no additional warranties, and was not a certified pre‐owned vehicle. Although the water leak was not identified until well past the first 60 days of ownership, the dealership had two fortunate breaks in their favor that allowed for the state mandated 60 day warranty to pass. First, the car was bought in the middle of winter, a time when it is unlikely to rain and provide the necessary evidence of a leak. Secondly, the leak was identified by the owner as only occurring when the car was parked on a downhill. These two variables working in tandem were, in the belief of the owner, the sole reason the leak was not identified closer to the purchase date of the car.</p>
				<p>When the car first began leaking, it was noted by the owner that the vehicle was backed into the driveway, which naturally slopes away from the house and towards the road. Given that it was a rainy few days, it was curious that the car only leaked on June 5th in the driveway, but not while parked in an office parking lot during the day while it was still raining. Over the course of the next few days, and trial and error while parking the car, it became apparent that the leak only developed when the car was parked on a decline, which gave the hint that it may have been caused by clogged FRONT drains in the sunroof. When the idea was suggested that the leak was pre‐existing before the car was purchased, the Service Manager responded by saying that the leak would have been noticed by the dealership when the car was put through the car wash if it had been pre‐existing. It is the contention of the owner that due to only a single drain being clogged, and the slope of the vehicle playing a factor in the leak, that a level floored car wash would not provide the decline angle, or enough volume of water to present evidence of the leak, and is an ineffective method of ensuring that the sunroof drains were not properly cleaned out.</p>

				<h3>Diagnosis</h3>
				<p><span class="snippet">On the morning of June 13th, the car was brought into Gengras to identify the cause of the leak</span> as a prerequisite for talking about any fault or reparations. It was determined that the leak could be assessed by the end of the day, at which time we could discuss a plan of action. <span class="snippet">The service manager assumed no responsibility for the leak</span>, and at best offered to “help a little” with the cost of the repairs, but did not mention, or commit to, any specific figures. <span class="snippet">Upon leaving the dealership, it was discovered that additional damage was done to the car</span> while it was being inspected during the day. First, <span class="snippet">the headliner was now soaked by the diagnosis efforts</span>. Previously, the water had only come in from under the steering column, or dripping out of the overhead light housing, but the headliner remained dry. The <a href="/images/damage/IMG_2145-notated.JPG" class="image reference">headliner now had water stains</a> on it, in addition to what appear to be <span class="snippet">“greasy finger marks” all over the interior “A” pillar, and around the cloth headliner</span> that surrounds the overhead light housing.</p>

				<h3>Damages Discussions</h3>
				<p><span class="snippet">On the morning of June 20th, discussions about any possible amiable resolution resumed at Gengras of Meriden</span>. The desire to get out of the car in question was communicated with Gengras staff, and discussions around getting into a similar used XC60<a href="#xc60">&dagger;</a> (black, fewer miles) that was on the lot and priced at $19,995 began. <span class="snippet">My car was appraised at $12,500, just 6 months beyond the purchase date, and more than $5,000 below the sale price (and $7,500 less than final cost)</span> of the vehicle. When the financials were presented, <span class="snippet">the cost of the trade‐in/upgrade would end up costing me $122/month additional over 72 months</span>, an absolutely unacceptable tradeoff. The appraisal price of the vehicle was borderline insulting. Once it became apparent that a trade‐in was not going to work out under the presented conditions, the inquiry was again made around repairs to the vehicle, and defining what exactly “help a little” meant. <span class="snippet">The original repair quote was for around $1,100 to fix the shorted out sunroof switch (approx. $500 parts, $600 labor) and clean the clogged sunroof drain</span>. <span class="snippet">It was proposed that I pay for the parts, and the dealer would take care of the labor costs</span>. <span class="snippet">This proposal was not exactly what I was looking for</span>, especially once the air conditioning malfunction was discovered, as there are suspected to be other problems existing with the vehicle that may not have fully manifested themselves yet. The repair estimate also does not guarantee the repair of the SRS system, nor the air conditioning malfunction. As a result, no resolutions were reached on June 20th.</p>

				<h3>1st Meeting with Gerry McDonald, General Manager</h3>
				<p>After continuous attempts to get in touch with the dealership with no returned phone calls, <span class="snippet">the general manager, Gerry McDonald, finally reached out to me and told me he would be discussing my issues with me</span>. After a brief phone conversation, <span class="snippet">I was told to come in for an appointment the following week, which I set with him over email for 2014/07/11 at 1:30pm</span>. <span class="snippet">Upon showing up at the dealership at 1:30pm, I was informed that Gerry had just left for lunch</span>, and he wouldn't eventually show up until about 1:50pm. I only mention this fact because I think it speaks volumes about the culture of customer service at Gengras Volvo.</p>
				<p>When I finally had the chance to sit down with Gerry, it became obvious very quickly that we did not see eye to eye on these issues. <span class="snippet">Gerry was very insistent that the cause of the leak was unknown</span>, and made it clear that he believed the drain clog and leak only happened after I purchased the vehicle, shirking all responsibility. His company's offer to fix the car remained the same, even in light of the new issues that had since presented themselves. His company's evaluation of the cars trade in value remained the same as well, although he suggested to me that he could re-evaluate the car once the new problems were diagnosed. <span class="snippet">Gerry suggested I get in touch with him once the car was back in the shop and diagnosed</span>.</p>
				<p>In the following weeks, once the car's additional problems were diagnosed, <span class="snippet">I made an attempt to <a href="/gerry-email.pdf" target="_blank" class="pdf">get in touch with Gerry 3 times over email</a>, and attempted to call him as well, with not a single one of my correspondences being returned</span>.</p>

				<h3>Air Conditioning Problems</h3>
				<p>Sometime in April, when the air conditioning was first used, a foul odor was omitted from the vents of the car. At the time, it was thought to be a dirty cabin filter, but looking back, certainly seems more likely to have been mold in or around the vents or air conditioning system, possibly caused by a previous leak. This is a small detail, but could provide an example of just how wide spread the water issues are in the vehicle.</p>
				<p><span class="snippet">Approximately 9 days (June 14th) after the leak was first discovered, the air conditioning began to malfunction</span> in the vehicle. Air that was colder than the outside temperature was being blown into the cabin, but it was very <a href="/images/damage/IMG_2143.JPG" class="image reference">obvious the A/C was not operating</a> at full capacity. After a Freon recharge resulted in no improvements, it was believed the issue is an electrical malfunction that potentially originated from the June 5th leak. The car went back into the Gengras Service Center in late July, where it was believed by the technicians to be a 2nd faulty Climate Control Module. The part needed to be ordered and would not be delivered for a few days.</p>
				<p>The <span class="snippet">car was brought into the shop again on August 1st to have the CCM replaced with the new computer</span>. In addition to having the A/C repaired, I attempted to procure the parts needed to repair the sunroof, and presented those to the dealership in an effort to have them fix the sunroof at this time as well. <span class="snippet">At the end of the day, I received a call from the service tech who stated the car was not fixed and would need to be kept through the weekend</span> to continue the repair on Monday, and that the part for the sunroof I brought in was not the needed part and would not be able to be used, because the parts they needed came as an assembly. I requested they save they part I brought in as I would need to return it where I bought it from. Not having the flexibility to be without a vehicle for the weekend and into Monday, I inquired about a loaner vehicle could be used until the car could be fixed. The request was accomodated by Gengras by arranging for an Enterprise Rental Car to be used through the weekend. The following <span class="snippet">Monday, I was notified that the car was still not fixed,</span> and they believed the replacement CCM to be faulty, and were ordering another to install. It was at this time that I let Gengras know <span class="snippet">I needed the car back on Friday, as I was going on vacation</span> out of the state on the upcoming Sunday.</p>
				<p>Another few days go by, and <span class="snippet">the phone rings on Wednesday with the news that the car is still not fixed</span>, and frankly, the technicians were stumped as to what the problem could be. It was requested the car stay in the shop for continued diagnosis. <span class="snippet">On Thursday, I was notified that the technicians thought that the shorted out sunroof (caused by the leak) was causing the A/C to malfunction</span> as both electronics were on a shared network. <span class="snippet">I was reluctant to have the sunroof fixed, as I obviously did not feel the $2,000+ bill should be my responsibility to fix, but in the interest of getting my car back, I agreed to the proposed repairs. I again reminded the dealership of my plans to go on vacation with the vehicle Sunday, and that I needed the work completed by Friday.</span></p>
				<p><span class="snippet">Friday afternoon, the phone rings again with what amounts to the real zenith of this story. The service rep tells me that there is no chance I will be getting my car returned to me at the end of the day, as the vehicle is currently dismantled and there are damaged wires in the roof...</span></p>

				<h3>A Mouse House</h3>
				<p><span class="snippet">...caused by chewing mice</span>, and evidenced by dead mice bodies and a nest. The wires will need to be repaired to have the sunroof fixed correctly, and they are not going to reassemble the car only to work on it again in the future. At this point, I'm simply speechless. I am leaving in 30 hours for a vacation that I anticipated driving to with my Volvo SUV, but found myself currently driving around an Enterprise Chevrolet Sonic (the equivilent size of a glorified go kart). <span class="snippet">The water leak, turned into shorted out sunroof, turned into airbag problem, turned into A/C malfunction, now turned into mouse damage</span> was borderline nightmare. The repair costs for the newest findings were never communicated to me, but I knew this would be adding onto my fiscal responsibility to this car. <span class="snippet">I suppose just for good measure, I decided to ask when the car would be able to be repaired</span>, thinking that I could delay my vacation for a day and pick up the car and leave on Monday, but I was told <span class="snippet">the technician working on my car <em>was also going on vacation the following week</em> and would be unable to continue working on the car until August 16th</span>. At this time, I needed to demand, beg, and plead my case for a car that I would be able to drive on my vacation. Gengras offered to put me into an XC90, which would have to suffice for my vacation<a href="#xc90">&dagger;&dagger;</a>.</p>
				<p>I did not hear from Gengras again until August 21st, this time getting the news that the car was <em>almost</em> ready to be picked up. A leak was discovered in the windshield, and the entire windshield needed to be replaced to address the problem. The repair would be covered under a Volvo warranty, and <span class="snippet">should be completed by Friday afternoon, August 22nd (21 days after the car was dropped off)</span>. At the time of picking up the car, <span class="snippet">I was required to pay for all parts related to the water leak that damaged the sunroof, and the majority of labor for repairs to the sunroof and the mice chewed wires</span>. The windshield was covered under a Volvo warranty, and the A/C was being covered under the warranty of the repair from the previous January. <span class="snippet">When asking Gengras for an itemized receipt, I was shown figures quickly on a computer screen and promptly told that it was not my right as a customer to have an itemized receipt</span>. At this time I asked for the sunroof part that I provided to be returned to me so that I may get a refund for the part. I was handed the original part, with evidence of the short, and told that it was the piece that I brought in. I vehemently denied this, and demanded to know that I was not charged for the assembly that I was informed was needed. I could not find evidence on the receipt of a part that fit the description of the one I provided, but I was outraged at this point that I was told the part could not be used, and then learned that it was in fact used in the car.</p>
				<p>Once again, within a day of driving away from Gengras, I was let down yet again by the work performed by the service department. Later that day <span class="snippet">I discovered that rear view mirror assembly was not properly re-attached to the windshield</span>, and the housing rattled while driving on the road. I was, at first, impressed with the job they did cleaning up the headliner, only to later find out that <span class="snippet">greasy finger prints that were under the sun visors were exempt from their cleaning process</span>. I have since reported the disappointing service to Gengras, at which time they offered to remedy the issues should I wish to bring the car back in, but I have declined the offer out of disgust.</p>

				<h3>2nd Meeting with Gerry McDonald, General Manager</h3>
				<p>At the time that I picked up the car from Gengras on August 22nd, I had asked that the car be re-evaluated for trade in as Gerry had suggested to me back in July. <span class="snippet">When I requested an updated quote, I was told I would need to speak with Gerry about the car</span>. I was told by Gerry that the original quote was assuming all repairs were made, and that offer was still the same now (obviously a different message than our 1st meeting). He suggested to me that he would take the weekend to re-evaluate my car, and suggest some options to get me into a different car. <span class="snippet">He <em>promised</em> he would get back to me on Monday (August 25th)</span> with some options.</p>
				<p><span class="snippet">Monday came and went, no word from Gerry. Tuesday, same. Wednesday, Thursday, same.</span> <span class="snippet">Friday I received a call from my original sales associate, John Rita, wishing me a happy birthday over the upcoming weekend, at which time I filled him in on my situation.</span> I let him know I was still waiting to hear back from Gerry, and <span class="snippet">John let me know he would leave a note on his desk to request a call to me. Gerry called me late Friday</span> (after 4pm) and left a voicemail. At this point, I was so disgusted, I did not return Gerry's call and he did not attempt to contact me again.</p>

				<h3>Customer Service Follow-Up</h3>
				<p>I had decided at this time that <span class="snippet">I was done dealing with Gengras</span> as it had gotten me nowhere. I was ready to move on and chalk this up as the worst consumer experience I could ever imagine. Then <span class="snippet">I received a phone call on August 28th from Gengras Customer Service asking me how my last service appointment went</span>. I spent 25 minutes on the phone telling the woman my experience as it has been laid out here. At the end of the call, she told me she would deliver my story to her manager and figure out if anything could be done to rectify my terrible experience. I begged her to be the first person at Gengras that actually cared about a customer, and give me a call back one way or another. <span class="snippet">Sandra told me she would call me back the next day</span> (Friday), if not Monday (which was Labor Day, so I figured she meant Tuesday). <span class="snippet">Tuesday came, no call. Wednesday, Thursday, no call. I tried to reach out to her Thursday, Friday, the following Monday, and left voicemails</span> asking her to give me a call and just update me on what happened. No return call. Monday, September 8th, <span class="snippet">I submitted an online form on the website asking for someone to call me back</span>. <span class="snippet">I received an email promising a phone call from Rebecca that day, but heard nothing that day</span>. I tried calling that number, and received a voicemail for an employee other than Rebecca, but I left a message asking for a call back. <span class="snippet">On the 9th, I submitted another request, again begging for someone to call me, and finally an employee reached out to me</span>. I once again gave my story, and expressed my concern for Sandra thinking she may have no longer been with the company, or maybe was out dealing with a personal issue. I was assured she was still with the company, but my case just got mixed up in the ranks with multiple people thinking someone else was handling it. <span class="snippet">I finally was forwarded to Krista, who I believe to be a manager of the customer service department. Krista was polite and helpful, and followed up with me when she said she would</span>. She apologized for my original phone call bouncing around throughout the company, but told me she would help resolve it. At this time, <span class="snippet">I learned that my inital complaint was actually sent to Gerry McDonald, which explained a lot to me</span> why I never heard back. I respectfully asked Krista to drop the issue because I did not have any interest in continuing to deal with Gerry. She assured me that talking to him was worth my time, and hopefully we could come to a resolution. I agreed to speak with him, and <span class="snippet">Gerry finally got back in touch with me</span>, at which time the only thing that changed was <span class="snippet">Gengras would offer me $500 more for the car ($13,000 of the original $20,000 purchase price), still a slap in the face</span>.</p>
				<p>That was my last interaction with Gengras.</p>

				<section class="footnote">
					<div id="xc60">
						<h4>&dagger;The Alternate Used XC60</h4>
						<p>As a side note, it was stated during the 6/20/2014 visit and during prior phone conversations that the leaky sunroof was not a common problem on the XC60. Although a simple Google search would provide evidence to the contrary, the staff at Gengras continued to insist that this was not an issue with the model, yet while looking at the used XC60 for sale, a service technician happened to have removed the same overhead lighting fixture from the used car to test in another XC60 currently in the shop for the exact same issue. This is relevant because if this is in fact a common problem with the vehicle, that provides even more incentive to have checked the sunroof drains for clogs both before the resale of the vehicle, and during the first service visit in January 2014, either of which could have prevented this problem.</p>
					</div>
					<div id="xc90">
						<h4>&dagger;&dagger;The Loaner XC90</h4>
						<p>Nothing tells your customer you care about them more then putting them into a $45,000 loaner car that looks like it has been through a war. Although I was thankful to have a vehicle to go on vacation with, the car I was given was a flat out embarassment. Between missing panels, cracked tail-lights, ripped up interior, missing components, and a rattling and unusable side view mirror (that would later fall off on the road), this car was the perfect representation of Gengras Volvo's attitude towards me as a customer.</p>

							<p>Warm day revealed air conditioning is no longer functioning properly. Max reading from vents was 65°</p>
							<p>While it cannot be said that the air conditioning malfunction is related to the leak, the timing is certainly curious, and they may be related. Once the air conditioning was recharged, which failed to fix the problem, it is believed the water may once again have caused a malfunction in the Climate Control Module.</p>

							<p>Meeting w/ Gerry McDonald</p>
							<p>I meet with Gerry McDonald to talk about my belief that the leak was a pre-existing condition of the car, and caused by neglect on the part of Gengras Volvo. Gerry shirks all responsibility and at best, can offer me a low-ball buyback price on the car, or a discounted labor cost for a partial repair.</p>
